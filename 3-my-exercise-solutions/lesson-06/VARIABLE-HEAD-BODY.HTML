Explanation:
Declaring the Variable:

In the <head> section, you declare the variable myVariable using a <script> tag.
Accessing the Variable:

In the <body> section, another <script> tag accesses the previously declared variable and modifies the content of an HTML element with the id of display.
This ensures that the variable is accessible throughout the document, as long as the script that uses the variable is placed after the script that declares it.
